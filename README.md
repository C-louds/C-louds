### 🌀 Who am I?  
- A CS student who thought **“pointers can’t be that bad”** (they were).  
- Footballer ⚽ who writes code with the same energy as a last-minute goal attempt.  
- Running on coffee, Linux crashes, and sheer **`git push --force`** energy.  
- I don’t "find bugs" — the bugs find me.  

---

### ⚡ Current Motto(s) (because one isn’t enough)
- *"Fiat lux"* — Let there be light (especially when debugging at 3 AM).  
- *"Memento mori"* — Remember you’re mortal (and so is your code).

### 🛠 Tech Playground
`C++` (the toxic love affair) • `Python` (the safe rebound) • `Linux` (Pop!_OS riced into chaos)  
`Git` (therapy + trauma) • `AI/ML` (because why not make the computer suffer too)

### 🎯 Currently Attempting
- Not breaking my Linux setup every other week.  
- Learning low-level C/C++ without low-level brain damage.  
- Writing side projects that start as “simple” and end as eldritch horror.

### 🌑 Fun & Chaos
- ⚽ Football practice = debugging muscle memory.  
- ☕ Coffee intake: enough to make me quantum vibrate.  
- 🎶 Playlists range from calm focus beats to absolute phonk noise(yes it is noise not a genre)
